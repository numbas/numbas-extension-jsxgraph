# JSXGraph extension for [Numbas](https://www.numbas.org.uk/)

This extension provides the [JSXGraph](https://jsxgraph.org) library, and a function `Numbas.extensions.jsxgraph.makeBoard` which makes it easy to use in a Numbas question.

There's [documentation at docs.numbas.org.uk](https://docs.numbas.org.uk/en/latest/extensions/jsxgraph.html).
